# Hey! Nice to see you ðŸ˜Ž  


Building in the blockchain space since 2017, I have been contributing to multiple ecosystems (Ethereum, Polkadot) in multiple languages (Rust, TypeScript, Clojure).
Now focusing on protocol development, system programming (Rust) and zero-knowledge and its applications.

Some projects I worked on:

* [lodestar](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar) Ethereum [consensus client](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#lodestar)
* ðŸ¦€ [substrate-playground](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-playground) and [governance-ui](https://github.com/paritytech/governance-ui) polkadot tooling
* [status.im](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile) a mobile Ethereum wallet/DApp browser
* [extensions-fiddle](https://github.com/jeluard/extensions-fiddle) a secure, decentralized and permissionless extension mechanism for mobile apps, using IPFS

Some other Open Source contributions:

* [bitbox](https://github.com/jeluard/bitbox) a NodeJS binary packager
* [frames-prover](https://github.com/jeluard/frames-prover) a farcaster frames Ethereum funds prover
